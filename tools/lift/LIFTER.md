# Lifter (6502 to portable C) -- prototype status

Goal: translate each analyzed Code range (per-bank) into C functions with
explicit CPU state (see runtime.h), resolving JSR/RTS as C calls, JMP-ind
ROM tables as switches over tracer-observed targets, and RAM vectors
(e.g. (007A) dispatcher at C9D2) as runtime switches fed by trace edges.
Bank switches become runtime calls switching PRG image pointers; the
fixed bank (C000-FFFF) is shared code.

## Prototype (DONE 2026-11-08)
lift.py handles a ca65 subset (labels incl. label+insn on one line,
ldx/inx/dex/stx/lda/and/cmp/rol/bne/rts/nop) and emits one C function
per entry label with goto labels inside. runtime.h provides CPU state +
RAM + split-port pad MMIO. Test: fixtures/input_snip.s is the real
input-strobe routine LE914 from bank7 (da65 output verbatim); make test
lifts it and runs 9 pad vectors -- all pass, Left gives F7=F8=02,
cross-checked against tracer -w F7 on hardware (same 02 from E929).
Tracer -w CLI bug found during cross-check and fixed.

## Next
Widen op coverage (sta/sty/txa/tay/branches/jsr/rts-as-call, flags),
whole-function lifting across Code ranges from info files, jump-table
switches from tracefeed data, then a parity harness: lifted bank vs
tracer watch diffs on recorded tapes.
